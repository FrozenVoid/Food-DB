Diacetyl arises naturally as a 
byproduct of fermentation. 
In some fermentative bacteria,
it is formed via the thiamine 
pyrophosphate-mediated 
condensation of pyruvate and
acetyl CoA.[3] Sour (cultured) 
cream, cultured buttermilk,
and cultured butter are produced
by inoculating pasteurized cream
or milk with a lactic starter 
culture, churning (agitating) 
and holding the milk until a 
desired pH drop (or increase in
acidity) is attained. Cultured 
cream, cultured butter, 
and cultured buttermilk owe
their tart flavour to 
lactic acid bacteria and their
buttery aroma and taste to 
diacetyl.[4]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allium 
Allium vegetables are considered bad for spiritual development in most Dharmic religions. Other qualities are repelling effect on supernatural entities(e.g. garlic repels vampires), increase in fire element and emotional instability.
In his writings, one sage Tsang-Tsze described the Alliums as the "five fragrant or spicy scented vegetables" - that each have a detrimental effect on one of the following five organs - liver, spleen, lungs, kidneys, and heart. Specifically, onions are harmful to the lungs, garlic to the heart, leeks to the spleen, chives to the liver and spring onions to the kidneys.

Alliums at high doses are toxic, producing anemia and are potent blood-thinners.

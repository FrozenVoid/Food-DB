Soaking is the alternative method of food preparation, replacing boiling and steaming.
A pot of cereal/grain that is usually boiled in 15 minutes can  be prepared by 60-120 minutes of soaking in cold water.

Note:Beans cannot be considered safe with soaking due having toxic hemmaglutinins inside https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytohaemagglutinin

Soaking increased nutrient availability(even if cooked afterwards)

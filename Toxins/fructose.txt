Fructose is a type of sugar.
However due some biological features it creates damage.
1.In concentrate form:HFCS, juices(essentially fructose solution),
sodas are rapidly absorbed and spike insulin.

2.All fructose is ready food for bacteria 
in mouth(lowers dental health) and concentration in
blood allows pathogens a food source. 

3.Modern sweet cultivars of fruit/vegetables are
especially problematic(their image is natural, health food),
because they are also nutrient sources filled
with fructose(and are **unhealthy** with exception of 
unripe fruit/vegetables). 

4.Fructose does not cause satiety, and relies on unique 
fructokinase pathway, easily overloaded
( see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-alcoholic_fatty_liver_disease )

5.Unlike glucose(blood sugar) it causes much more cell 
damage and binds easily to proteins

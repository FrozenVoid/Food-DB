Sea salts unless highly filtered(most is "natural"/"raw"/"organic") and processed to remove undesired elements contains all the heavy metals and toxins which pollute the seas(i.e. sea salt is essentially concentrate of sea water - and all pollution eventually reaches the ocean).
Rock salts aren't that pure either and can contain many sources of metals(esp. colored salts).
While it does contain beneficial minerals/elements, much better food sources exist where the compound is combined with enzymes and fibers(iodine - garlic, selenium - Brazil Nuts,etc). Salt itself is a biologically dead medium.

Additionally, many anti-caking agents in salt are toxic or degrade to
toxic compounds.

Topical application of olive oil for 4 weeks caused a significant 
reduction in stratum corneum integrity and induced mild erythema in 
volunteers with and without a history of atopic dermatitis. Sunflower 
seed oil preserved stratum corneum integrity, did not cause erythema, 
and improved hydration in the same volunteers. In contrast to sunflower 
seed oil, topical treatment with olive oil significantly damages the 
skin barrier, and therefore has the potential to promote the development
 of, and exacerbate existing, atopic dermatitis. The use of olive oil 
for the treatment of dry skin and infant massage should therefore be 
discouraged. These findings challenge the unfounded belief that all 
natural oils are beneficial for the skin and highlight the need for 
further research.

Instead of uniform "This chemical causes cancer" warning that is 
too broad to apply to everything, use tiers describing scale of risk:
Tier 1 - Proven to cause cancer at low dose/exposure
Tier 2 - Proven to cause cancer in high dose/exposure
Tier 3 - Strongly suspected to cause cancer at low dose/exposure
Tier 4 - Strongly suspected to cause cancer at high dose/exposure
Tier 5 - Suspected to cause cancer at low dose/exposure
Tier 6 - Suspected to cause cancer at high dose/exposure
Tier 7 - Cancer risk suggested by some studies

Neu5Gc, a non-human sialic acid sugar molecule common in red meat that increases the risk of tumor formation in humans, is also prevalent in pig organs, with concentrations increasing as the organs are cooked, a study by researchers from the UC Davis School of Medicine and Xiamen University School of Medicine has found.
Occurrence


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-Glycolylneuraminic_acid#Occurrence
Neu5Gc is found in most mammals, with exceptions like humans, ferrets, the platypus, western dog breeds and New World monkeys.[6] Trace amounts can be found in humans, even though the gene to encode for production of Neu5Gc was eliminated long ago. These trace amounts come from consumption of animals in human diet. Mainly, the sources are red meats such as lamb, pork, and beef. It can also be found in dairy products, but to a lesser extent. Some 1.1% of the identified Neu5Ac is actually Neu5Gc in commercial whey protein.[7] Neu5Gc cannot be found in poultry and is found in only trace amounts in fish. This confirms that Neu5Gc is mainly found in foods of mammalian origin.[4] Lanolin in shampoo also contains Neu5Gc.[8]

In 2017, scientists succeeded in indirectly identifying the presence of Neu5GC from multiple ancient animal fossils dated to over a millions years ago, the oldest of which was dated to around 4 Mya.[9]
